Built in Types

# Types

## This
The `This` datatype refers to the current item or reusable datatype. 

For example, if an Animal item type had a property whose datatype was `This`, the type would be Animal. When a item or type is extended, the `This` refers to the extended type name even if it was included in a parent type.

## Any
The `Any` datatype means that any Item type can be used as the property's datatype.

The `Any` datatype only refers to Item types, not Reusable types.
