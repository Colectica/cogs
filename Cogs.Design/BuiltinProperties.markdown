Built in Properties
==============

# Properties

## Language
`Language` is a built in property, which is defined and used to indicate the language of any item's or reusable datatype's contents.

The datatype of a `Language` property is fixed to the `language` simple type.

## DcTerms
`DcTerms` is a collection of built in properties from Dublin Core. The terms expand from the built in `DcTerms` property.

The terms from http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ are included in the model as properties by inclusion of this built in property.
