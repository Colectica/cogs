COGS
====

COGS lets you specify your information model in plain text.
From this model, multiple output formats are generated. 
Plain text specifications allow using industry-standard tools like git 
to manage collaboration.

The Convention-based Ontology Generation System (COGS) gives you a powerful,
patterns-based way to build models. COGS enables a clean separation of
concerns and gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile
development. COGS includes many features that enable fast, test-driven
development, allowing you to publish sophisticated models in a variety of formats.

COGS is for domain experts and groups who value ease of collaboration and low
technical barriers for participation.
