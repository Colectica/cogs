Articles
--------

Articles allow you to include extra content in the documentation that is generated 
for your model.

Each article is a reStructuredText file, and is included in the Sphinx documentation.

toc.txt
~~~~~~~

To include an article in the top level table of contents generated by Sphinx, 
you can include the path of the article in the :file:`{baseDirectory}/Articles/toc.txt`
file. This file contains one path per line.

Example Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an example, assume the following directory structure.

* *baseDirectory*/

  * Articles/

    * toc.txt
    * about/

      * index.rst
      * contact-us.rst
      * license.rst

In this case, the :file:`toc.txt` file might contain a reference to ``about/index``.
The rest of the files do not need to be added because they can be references from
the :file:`about/index.rst` file.
