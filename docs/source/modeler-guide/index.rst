Modeler's Guide
===============

With COGS, you can specify your information model in plain text. This section describes the 
text and CSV files that define your model.

A COGS model consists of the following core components.

:doc:`item-types`
    Item types are the identified entities in your model. They consist of definitions and 
    properties.
:doc:`composite-types`
    Composite types are complex types used as data types, but they are not identified.
:doc:`settings`
    Settings define project-level information, including things like the 
    title of your model, copyright information, and more.
:doc:`topics`
    Topics allow you to describe subsets of your model, to make it easier for people
    to learn about your model.
:doc:`articles`
    Articles allow you to include extra content in the documentation that is generated
    for your model.
:doc:`primitive-types`
    COGS provides a number of primitive types you can use to define properties on
    items in your model.
